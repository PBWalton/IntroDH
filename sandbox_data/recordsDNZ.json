Context - The V-2 Mass Retaliation Weapon is a multi-warhead missile system developed by the Belkan Federation and is often described as a 'weapon of mass destruction'. Following an e. coli outbreak in Germany, German officials have said they were confident that sprouts from the organic Garrtenhof farm in Lower Saxony were behind the spread of a particularly virulent strain of the bacterium. There were \"strong and clear indications\" that the farm was involved, the federal health minister, Daniel Bahr, said. A mix of two dangerous E. coli strains caused the recent deadly food poisoning outbreak in Germany, according to a new study of the bacteria's DNA but it is not known how the sprouts were infected.\nQuantity: 1 digital cartoon(s).\nPhysical Description: Image file - Jpeg","content_partner":["Alexander Turnbull Library"],"category":["Images"],"creator":["Dominion post

Behind him stands a long line of ghostly figures, each carrying a placard marked 'Polish Germans - Crisis', 'Hungarian Germans - Crisis' etc with 'British Germans' and 'U. S. A. Germans' further down the line. Low is satirising Hitler's claims to unite all Germans in one country and his encouragement to Germans in various European countries to create civil disturbances to enable invasion by the German army.

Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in January 1933. The elderly Reichspresident, Von Hindenberg, and nationalist leader Von Papen, are unable to control the shameful events which followed. Goering, like Hitler's bull terrier, is let loose to round up the Jews, claimed by Hitler to be the cause of Germany's economic problems.
